The machine learning algorithms work in two phases:
- The training phase.
- The inference phase.

Setup a local repository.
Link the repo to a remote Github repository.
Activate the virtual environment for both the Django project and Jupyter Notebook.
	source bin/activate
	ipython kernel install --user --name=venv

The next step is to build the machine learning algorithms.
Install the necessary ML libraries:
	- numpy
	- pandas
	- sklearn
	- joblib
Use Google Collaboratory Notebook to host the code.

Create an Endpoints application that will be used for the HTTP REST API.
Create models for the Endpoints application.
These models will map to database tables that will be stored by Django using SQLite.

Create the REST API for our endpoints.

We need to define serializers for our models. The serializers will handle the mapping of database objects to and from HTTP requests.
