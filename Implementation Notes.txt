The machine learning algorithms work in two phases:
- The training phase.
- The inference phase.

Setup a local repository.
Link the repo to a remote Github repository.
Activate the virtual environment for both the Django project and Jupyter Notebook.
	source bin/activate
	ipython kernel install --user --name=venv

The next step is to build the machine learning algorithms.
Install the necessary ML libraries:
	- numpy
	- pandas
	- sklearn
	- joblib
Use Google Collaboratory Notebook to host the code.
